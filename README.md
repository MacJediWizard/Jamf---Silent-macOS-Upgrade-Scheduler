# Jamf Silent macOS Upgrade Scheduler

A silent macOS upgrade orchestration wrapper for [Graham Pugh's erase-install](https://github.com/grahampugh/erase-install),  
designed for enterprise environments using Jamf Pro or other MDMs.

This script silently pre-caches macOS installers and prompts users only at the final decision point, balancing user flexibility with enforced upgrade deadlines.  
Now with **automatic dependency installation**, **snooze functionality**, **login-time installation**, and **comprehensive diagnostics**.
