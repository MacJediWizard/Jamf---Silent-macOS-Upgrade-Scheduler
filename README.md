# Jamf Silent macOS Upgrade Scheduler

A silent macOS upgrade orchestration wrapper for [Graham Pugh's erase-install](https://github.com/grahampugh/erase-install),  
designed for enterprise environments using Jamf Pro or other MDMs.

This script silently pre-caches macOS installers and prompts users only at the final decision point, balancing user flexibility with enforced upgrade deadlines.  
Now with **automatic dependency installation**, **snooze functionality**, **login-time installation**, and **comprehensive diagnostics**.

## Usage

1. Deploy the script to client Macs via Jamf Pro or another MDM.
2. Ensure erase-install and swiftDialog are either installed or allow the script to auto-install them.
3. Customize top-of-script variables as needed (macOS version, dialog texts, etc).
4. Launch the script manually, via Jamf policy, or a LaunchDaemon trigger.

## Scheduling Options

The script now provides multiple scheduling options:

- **Install Now**: Begins installation immediately
- **Schedule Today**: Allows selecting a time later today 
- **Defer 24 Hours**: Postpones for 24 hours (up to configured maximum)
- **Snooze**: Short-term deferral (configurable, default 4 hours)
- **Install at Login**: Schedule installation for next user login

## Diagnostics

For troubleshooting, the script can generate a comprehensive diagnostic report that includes:
- System configuration details
- Dependency status
- Deferral state
- Environment variables
- LaunchDaemon status
- Recent log entries

This report is saved to `/Library/Logs/erase-install-diagnostics.txt`.
